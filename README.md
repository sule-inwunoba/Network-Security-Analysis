# Incident Report Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of the Incident Report Analysis project was to investigate and respond to a cybersecurity incident within a corporate environment. This project simulated real-world attack scenarios, involving the analysis of compromised accounts, detection of malicious activity, and mitigation of risks using security tools. The key focus was to establish security measures to prevent future breaches and enhance the overall security posture.

## Skills Learned
- Enhanced understanding of incident response protocols and security policies.
- Proficiency in analyzing access logs and identifying unauthorized access patterns.
- Improved ability to detect and respond to phishing attacks.
- Hands-on experience in implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and network security measures.
- Development of collaborative incident response strategies with cross-functional teams.

## Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Firewall and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for network traffic monitoring and protection.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system for securing user accounts.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing network activity.

## Steps and Screenshots

Ref 1: Incident Summary
The incident involved a malicious phishing attempt that compromised an intern's network credentials. Logs indicated unauthorized access to the customer database, with data being manipulated or deleted. A thorough investigation followed to understand the scope of the breach and implement corrective measures.

Ref 2: Incident Management Response
In this screenshot, the response team identified the source of the breach and the method used to gain access. Security policies were revised, and MFA was implemented to strengthen account security. Additionally, data recovery procedures were initiated using the last night's backup to restore compromised customer information.
